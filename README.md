https://neurovault.org/collections/503/

This dataset contains single trial responses to 30 images from the International Affective Picture Set from 182 subjects. These data were used to train the Picture Induced Negative Emotion Signature described in Chang et al., 2015 (http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002180). The details of the experiment can be seen in Gianaros et al., 2014 (doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.10.012) Negative photographs (Pictures: 2053, 3051, 3102, 3120, 3350, 3500, 3550, 6831, 9040, 9050, 9252, 9300, 9400, 9810, 9921) depicted bodily illness and injury (10 photographs), acts of aggression (2 photographs), members of hate groups (1 photograph), transportation accidents (1 photograph) and human waste (1 photograph). Neutral photographs (Pictures: 5720, 5800, 7000, 7006, 7010, 7040, 7060, 7090, 7100,7130, 7150, 7217, 7490, 7500, 9210) depicted inanimate objects (10 photographs) or neutral scenes (5 photographs).
